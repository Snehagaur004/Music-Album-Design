Concept- 
It is a motion UI/UX Design. It elaborates concept of a girl who has been lost somewhere in the world. Here CD's Case is Lord Krishna  and CD is the Girl herself. 
When the girl doesn't listen to Lord Krishna, she finds herself lost in a strange world where she is alone, confused & in heavy pain. 
But as she went under the shade of Lord Krishna, she finds herself in graceful peace. She becomes happy, clear and painfree.

I used Motion designing in UI/UX to present this concept. This includes the  creation of hover effects, animation, font combination, Visual hierarchy, Interactive designs.
Here are the snapshots of the project-:
